_(Adapted from the [Rands Leadership Slack code of conduct](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#not-for-profit-mostly))_

This is a community, not a free audience. This is not a place for prominent commercial activities such as recruiting, lead generation, marketing, market research, or other solicitation, except in channels dedicated to that purpose. **If you join this community to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly react as though you are an intruder.** As this community grows, our tolerance for unsolicited commercial behavior decreases.

If you have a body of content you'd like to promote, our recommended way of doing so is to be an active and positive member of the server. If someone has a question that you've created an external answer to, we'd love if you share it! While apparent commercial behavior is easy to identify, non-obvious commercial behavior is a grey area. In general, if you are wondering if a post is commercially appropriate, our guidelines are that you:

- Ask permission from the channel before posting a message that might be considered commercial, stating clear intent for the post, and,
- Listen to the response of your peers in the channel and act accordingly.

If, after engaging with the community, you are still wondering if a specific message is commercial or not, please ask in one of the channels dedicated to helping find their way in this community, such as contacting the admins [by email](mailto:hello@reactiflux.com). To help determine if what you want to share is an advertisement, here are some questions to help inform your decision:

You should be able to answer "yes" to:

- Did you make it yourself, or contribute to its creation?
- Is it relevant to our members?
- Can people benefit without paying?

And "no" to:

- Are you announcing an announcement?
- Are you soliciting [spec work](https://www.nospec.com/)?
- Are you running a giveaway, airdrop, or other contest?
- Are you directly asking people to subscribe for updates?

We grant more leeway to members who have been active participants in the community, as well. If you're unsure, reach out to discuss.

We want the majority of what's shared to be created by genuine members of Nodeiflux. Active members ask questions, share knowledge, or simply follow along with the chat (make sure to drop a note in #introductions!).

# Guidelines for common types of promotion

### Recruiting and finding collaborators

Nodeiflux does not present offer a space for recruitment or advertising a project in search of collaborators.

### Conferences, meetups, and mixers

Conferences shared must have a website with a Code of Conduct. Meetups and mixers are advised to do so as well. Conferences should limit their announcements to 1 per major milestone, like an initial announcement, CFP deadlines, registration deadlines, and when it's about to happen, would all be appropriate.

### Personal writing and business content

As a community, we most highly value personal writing and content produced by individuals. livestreams and other educational content may also be shared here. Members are expected to participate more broadly than promoting their body of work, and moderators may reach out if the balance has shifted too far towards promotion.

### Vlogs, streams, and other serialized content

If you're sharing episodic content like a video series, livestream, or podcast, please refrain from promoting each new episode â€” we'd prefer that you share the show/channel/etc itself. For long-running shows we ask that you only promote it weekly.

### Paid content

Books, courses, and other bodies of work behind a pay wall should not be shared, except in response to another member. We encourage recommending materials that will help members advance, but strongly prefer it resemble networking rather than advertising.

### Surveys

Nodeiflux only allows surveys from private organizations if they're shared by an active member of the community. Surveys may be posted if the results will be public or used for academic purposes, and should only be shared once. Fair warning: most surveys get relatively low uptake, they just aren't of interest to many in the community.

# Specific types of promotion

## Outside communities

Nodeiflux generally does not allow external communities to be promoted. If another server would better serve someone, then members are welcome to share server invites with an explanation of why. Announcements or promotions of communities must be of obvious interest to the majority of the Nodeiflux community, should not be the only participation within the community, and must have commercial interest disclosed.

## Paid help and tutoring

Nodeiflux is a community of developers helping each other out, but sometimes the amount of help someone is seeking may become a significant time investment for the person helping them. In circumstances like this, Nodeiflux supports our members reaching out to discuss private tutoring.

This is only something we allow for members who are active in the main purpose of the server; members with low or infrequent activity are not allowed to make offers like this. Members should post publicly to ask permission to DM about tutoring, but discussion of the specific arrangements (frequency, compensation, etc) should be done in private.

Nodeiflux staff are not able to mediate disputes that arise from arrangements like this, and members who participate in this way are subjected to increased moderator scrutiny.
