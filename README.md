# Welcome to Nodeiflux

Hi! Nodeiflux is a community of developers using JS to build things (mostly on Node). You can find us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/vUsrbjd).

## Nodeiflux is for you

### For professional developers

Nodeiflux can be a great complement to your team. Especially if you're at a smaller company or don't have many peers doing similar work as you, an online community like Nodeiflux can fill a similar role to a more experienced coworker. Get help with thorny problems in #help, discuss an upcoming performance review in #career-questions, and stay on top of the latest news in #news.

### For indie devs and freelancers

Nodeiflux works great as a virtual coworking space. Share your work in #i-built-this, or share your writing and videos to #content. Connect with folks hiring for jobs in #job-board, or find other collaborators for non-commercial work in #collaborators.

### For those learning to code

Nodeiflux is largely comprised of professional developers, so there's a level of proficiency with the basic skills of software development assumed. We can help you debug or better understand some code, but requests for tutoring, mentorship, or broad questions like "it's not working" tend not to get a big response. Ask questions about your code in #help, share what you're working on in #i-built-this, and share resources you found helpful in #content.

## Rules and norms

This is a social space covered by a [Code of Conduct](./CONDUCT.md). As a social space, there will be many unwritten norms that develop organically â€” please be mindful of these and make an effort to "read the room" (though online spaces are notoriously hard to read in that way).

Generally, though, the community tends to respond well to members who share knowledge and participate in a way that is authentic. Questions that appear as low effort tend to get similarly low effort answers, and sharing a project or blog in a way that feels inauthentic tends to be viewed as spammy.

As a gathering ground for developers, we naturally attract many with an interest in promotion, whether commercial or not. Please consult our [promotion guidelines](./promotion.md) for more information about how to effectively promote something in Nodeiflux.
